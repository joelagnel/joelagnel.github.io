  <div class="entry-content"><p>Userspace program when compiled to native can place tracepoints in them using a USDT (User Statically Defined Tracing), the details of the tracepoints (such as address and arguments) are placed as a note in the ELF binary for other tools to interpret. This at first seems much better than using Uprobes directly on userspace functions, since the latter not only needs symbol information from the binary but is also at the mercy of compiler optimizations and function inlining. In Android we directly write into <code>tracing_mark_write</code> for userspace tracepoints. While this has its advantages (simplicity), it also means that the only way to &ldquo;process&rdquo; the trace information for ALL tracing usecases is by reading back the trace buffer to userspace and processing them offline, thus needing a full user-kernel-user round trip. Further its not possible to easily create triggers on these events (dump the stack or stop tracing when an event fires, for example). Uprobes event tracing on the other hands gets the full benefit that ftrace events do. Also all userspace emitted trace data is a string which has to be parsed and post-processed. USDT seems a nice way to solve some of these problems, since we can then use the user-provided data and create Uprobes at the correct locations, and process these on the fly using BCC without things ever hitting the trace buffer or returning to userspace.</p>

<p>This simple article is based on some notes I made while playing with USDT probes. To build a C program with an SDT probe, you can just include <code>sdt.h</code> and <code>sdt-config.h</code> from the Ubuntu systemtap-sdt-devel package, which works for both arm64 and x86.</p>

<p>C program can be as simple as:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#include "sdt.h"
</span><span class='line'>int main() {
</span><span class='line'>  DTRACE_PROBE("test", "probe1");
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>One compiling this, a new <code>.note.stapsdt</code> ELF section is created, which can be read by:
<code>readelf -n &lt;bin-path&gt;</code></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Displaying notes found in: .note.stapsdt
</span><span class='line'>  Owner                 Data size Description
</span><span class='line'>  stapsdt              0x00000029 NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)
</span><span class='line'>    Provider: "test"
</span><span class='line'>    Name: "probe1"
</span><span class='line'>    Location: 0x0000000000000664, Base: 0x00000000000006f4, Semaphore: 0x0000000000000000
</span><span class='line'>    Arguments: </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here there are no arguments, however we can use <code>DTRACE_PROBE2</code> to pass more, for example for 2 of them:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>int main() {
</span><span class='line'>  int a = 1;
</span><span class='line'>  int b = 2;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  DTRACE_PROBE2("test", "probe1", a, b);
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>readelf</code> tool now reads:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Displaying notes found in: .note.stapsdt
</span><span class='line'>  Owner                 Data size Description
</span><span class='line'>  stapsdt              0x00000040 NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)

</span><span class='line'>    Arguments: -4@-4(%rbp) -4@-8(%rbp)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Notice how the arguments show exactly how to access the parameters at the location. In this case, we know the arguments are on the stack and at momention offsets from the base pointer.</p>

<p>Compiling with <code>-f-omit-frame-pointer</code> shows the following in <code>readelf</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Displaying notes found in: .note.stapsdt
</span><span class='line'>  Owner                 Data size Description

</span><span class='line'>    Arguments: -4@-4(%rsp) -4@-8(%rsp)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Without the base pointer, the compiler relies on the stack pointer for the arguments. However notice that even though the C program is identical to the previous example, the &ldquo;arguments&rdquo; in the note section of the ELF has changed. This dynamic nature is one of the key reasons why SDT probes are so much better than say using <code>perf probe</code> directly to install Uprobes in the wild. With some help userspace and the compiler, we have more reliable information to access arguments without needing any DWARF debug info.</p>

<p>Compiling with ARM64 gcc shows a slightly different output for the Arguments. Note that that Arguments is just a string which can be post processed by tools to fetch the probe data.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    Arguments: -4@[sp, 12] -4@[sp, 8]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>USDT limitations as I see it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No information about types is stored. This is kind of sad, since now inorder to know what do with the values, one needs more information. These tracepoints were used with DTrace and SystemTap and turns out the scripts that probe these tracepoints are where the type information is stored or assumed. Uprobes tracer supports &ldquo;string&rdquo; but without knowing that the USDT is a string value, there&rsquo;s no way a Uprobe can be created on it, since all the stap note tells us is that there&rsquo;s a pointer there (who knows if its a 64-bit integer or a character pointer, for example).</p></li>
<li><p>Argument names are also not stored. This means arguments have to be in the same order in the debug script as they are in the program being debugged.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It seems with a little bit of work, both these things can be added. Does that warrant a new section or can the stapsdt section be augment without causing breakage of existing tools? I don&rsquo;t know yet.</p>

<h2>SDT parsing logic</h2>

<p>BCC has a USDT parser written to extract probes from the ELF. Read <code>parse_stapsdt_note</code> in <code>src/cc/bcc_elf.c</code> in the BCC tree for details.</p>

<h2>Dynamic programming languages</h2>

<p>Programs that are interpretted can&rsquo;t provide this information ahead of time. The <a href="https://github.com/sthima/libstapsdt#how-it-works">libstapsdt</a> tries to solve this by <a href="https://github.com/sthima/libstapsdt/blob/6045277309ff0425322bed5e71393ce5c8fa1344/src/libstapsdt.c#L89">creating a shared library on the fly</a> and linking to it from the dynamic program. This seems a bit fragile but appears to have users. There are wrappers in Python and Nodejs. <a href="https://medium.com/sthima-insights/we-just-got-a-new-super-power-runtime-usdt-comes-to-linux-814dc47e909f">Check this article</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Open question I have:
* Do any existing Linux tools handle USDT strings? Uprobe tracer does support strings, so the infrastructure seems to be there. I didn&rsquo;t see any hints of this in <a href="src/cc/usdt/usdt_args.cc">BCC</a>. Neither does <a href="https://github.com/sthima/libstapsdt/blob/6045277309ff0425322bed5e71393ce5c8fa1344/src/libstapsdt.h#L14">libstapsdt</a> seem to have this.</p>

<h2>Other ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Creating Uprobes on the fly when a process is loaded: Ideally speaking, if the ELF note section had all the information that the kernel needed, then we could create the Uprobe events for the uprobe trace events at load time and keep them disabled without needing userspace to do anything else. This seems crude at first, but in the &ldquo;default&rdquo; case, it would still have almost no-overhead. This does mean that all the information Uprobe tracing needs will have to be stored in the note section. The other nice thing about this is, you no longer need to know the PID of all processes with USDTs in them. EDIT: This idea is flawed. Uprobes are created before a process is loaded AFAIU now, using the binary path of the executable and libraries. What&rsquo;s more useful is to maintain a cache of all executables in the file system, and their respective instrumentation points. Then on boot up, perhaps we can create all necessary uprobes from early userspace.</p></li>
<li><p>For dynamic languages, <code>libstapsdt</code> seems great, but it feels a bit hackish since it creates a temporary file for the stub. Perhaps uprobes can be created after the temporary file is dlopen&#8217;ed and then the file can be unlinked if it hasn&rsquo;t been already, so that there aren&rsquo;t any more references to the temporary file in the file system. Such a temporary file could also probably be in a RAM based file system perhaps.</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This article (with some edits) also <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/744522/">appeared on LWN</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/README.md">BCC (BPF Compiler Collection)</a> is a toolkit and a suite of kernel
tracing tools that allow systems engineers to efficiently and safely get a deep understanding into the inner workings of
a Linux system. Because they can&rsquo;t crash the kernel, they are safer than kernel modules and can be run in production
environments. <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/ebpf.html">Brendan Gregg has written</a> nice tools and given talks showing the
full power of eBPF based tools. Unfortunately, BCC has no support for a cross-development workflow. I define
&ldquo;cross-development&rdquo; as a development workflow in which the development machine and the target machine running the
developed code are different. Cross-development is very typical among Embedded System kernel developers who often
develop on a powerful x86 host and then flash and test their code on SoCs (System on Chips) based on the ARM
architecture. Not having a cross-development flow gives rise to several complications, lets go over them and discuss a
solution called BPFd that cleverly addresses this issue.</p>

<p>In the Android kernel team, we work mostly on ARM64 systems, since most Android devices are on this architecture. BCC
tools support on ARM64 systems has stayed broken for years. One of the reasons for this difficulty is with ARM64 inline
assembler statements. Unavoidably, kernel header includes in BCC tools result in inclusion of asm headers which in the
case of ARM64 has the potential of spewing inline asm ARM64 instructions <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/iovisor-dev@lists.iovisor.org/msg00299.html">causing major
pains</a>  to LLVM&rsquo;s BPF backend. Recently this
issue got fixed by BPF inline asm support (these
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/2865ab6996164e7854d55c9e21c065fad7c26569">LLVM</a> <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/commit/a6b7d22c2e64f44e6c74ad7e5ce5670f5ae72da3">commits</a>) and <a href="(https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/1202">folks could finally run BCC
tools on arm64</a>), but..</p>

<p>In order for BCC tools to work at all, they need kernel sources. This is because most tools need to register callbacks
on the ever-changing kernel API in order to get their data. Such callbacks are registered using the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/132196/">kprobe</a> infrastructure. When a BCC tool is run, BCC switches its current directory
into the kernel source directory before compilation starts, and compiles the C program that embodies the BCC tool&rsquo;s
logic. The C program is free to include kernel headers for <code>kprobes</code> to work and to use kernel data structures.</p>

<p>Even if one were not to use <code>kprobes</code>, BCC also implicity adds a common <code>helpers.h</code> include directive  whenever an eBPF
C program is being compiled, found in <code>src/cc/export/helpers.h</code> in the BCC sources. This <code>helpers.h</code> header uses the
<code>LINUX_VERSION_CODE</code> macro to create a &ldquo;version&rdquo; section in the compiled output. <code>LINUX_VERSION_CODE</code> is available only
in the specific kernel&rsquo;s sources being targeted and is used during eBPF program loading to make sure the BPF program is
being loaded into a kernel with the right version. As you can see, kernel sources quickly become mandatory for compiling
eBPF programs.</p>

<p>In some sense this build process is similar to how external kernel modules are built. Kernel sources are large in size
and often can take up a large amount of space on the system being debugged. They can also get out of sync, which may
make the tools misbehave.</p>

<p>The other issue is Clang and LLVM libraries need to be available on the target being traced. This is because the tools
compile the needed BPF bytecode which are then loaded into the kernel. These libraries take up a lot space. It seems
overkill that you need a full-blown compiler infrastructure on a system when the BPF code can be compiled elsewhere and
maybe even compiled just once. Further, these libraries need to be cross-compiled to run on the architecture you&rsquo;re
tracing. That&rsquo;s possible, but why would anyone want to do that if they didn&rsquo;t need to? Cross-compiling compiler
toolchains can be tedious and stressful.</p>

<h2>BPFd: A daemon for running eBPF BCC tools across systems</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd">Sources for BPFd can be downloaded here</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of loading up all the tools, compiler infrastructure and kernel sources onto the remote targets being traced and
running BCC that way, I decided to write a proxy program named BPFd that receives commands and performs them on behalf
of whoever is requesting them. All the heavily lifting (compilation, parsing of user input, parsing of the hash maps,
presentation of results etc) is done by BCC tools on the host machine, with BPFd running on the target and being the
interface to the target kernel. BPFd encapsulates all the needs of BCC and performs them &ndash; this includes loading a BPF
program, creating, deleting and looking up maps, attaching a eBPF program to a kprobe, polling for new data that the
eBPF program may have written into a perf buffer, etc. If it&rsquo;s woken up because the perf buffer contains new data, it&rsquo;ll
inform BCC tools on the host about it, or it can return map data whenever requested, which may contain information
updated by the target eBPF program.</p>

<h3>Simple design</h3>

<p>Before this work, the BCC tools architecture was as follows:
<img src="images/bcc-arch.png" alt="BCC architecture" /></p>

<p>BPFd based invocations partition this, thus making it possible to do cross-development and execution of the tools across
machine and architecture boundaries. For instance, kernel sources that the BCC tools depend on can be on a development
machine, with eBPF code being loaded onto a remote machine. This partioning is illustrated in the following diagram:
<img src="images/bcc-with-bpfd-arch.png" alt="BCC architecture with BPFd" /></p>

<p>The design of BPFd is quite simple, it expects commands on <code>stdin</code> (standard input) and provides the results over
<code>stdout</code> (standard output). Every command a single line always, no matter how big the command is. This allows easy
testing using <code>cat</code>, since one could simply <code>cat</code> a file with commands, and check if BPFd&rsquo;s <code>stdout</code> contain the
expected results. Results from a command, however can be multiple lines.</p>

<p>BPF maps are data structures that a BPF program uses to store data which can be
retrieved at a later time. Maps are represented by file descriptor returned by
the <code>bpf</code> system call once the map has been successfully created.
For example, following is a command to BPFd for creating a BPF hashtable map.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>BPF_CREATE_MAP 1 count 8 40 10240 0</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the result from BPFd is:</p>

<p>Since BPFd is proxying the map creation, the file descriptor (3 in this example) is
 mapped into <code>BPFd's</code> file descriptor table. The file descriptor can be used later to
look up entries that the BPF program in the kernel may have created, or to clear all
entries in the map, as is done by tools that periodically clear the accounting done
by a BPF program.</p>

<p>The <code>BPF_CREATE_MAP</code> command in this example tells BPFd to create a map named
<code>count</code> with map type 1 (<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h#L101">type 1 is a hashtable
map</a>),
with a key size of 8 bytes and a value size of 40, maximum of 10240 entries and
no special flags. BPFd created a map and identified by file descriptor 3.</p>

<p>With the simple standard input/output design, it&rsquo;s possible to write wrappers around BPFd to handle more advanced
communication methods such as USB or Networking. As a part of my analysis work in the Android kernel team, I am
communicating these commands over the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge</a>
which interfaces with the target device over either USB or TCP/IP. I have shared several demos below.</p>

<h3>Changes to the BCC project for working with BPFd</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/">BCC</a> needed several changes to be able to talk
to BPFd over a remote connection. All these changes <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/tree/bcc-bpfd">are available
here</a> and will be pushed
upstream soon.</p>

<p>Following are all the BCC modifications that have been made:</p>

<h4>Support for remote communication with BPFd such as over the network</h4>

<p>A new <code>remotes</code> module has been added to BCC tools with an abstraction that
different remote types, such as networking or USB must implement. This keeps
code duplication to a minimum. By implementing <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/blob/bcc-bpfd/src/python/bcc/remote/base.py">the functions
needed</a>
for a remote, a new communication method can be easily added. Currently an
<code>adb</code> remote and a <code>process</code> remote are provided. The <code>adb</code> remote is for
communication with the target device over USB or TCP/IP using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html">Android
Debug Bridge</a>. The
<code>process</code> remote is probably useful just for local testing. With the <code>process</code> remote,
BPFd is forked on the same machine running BCC and communicates with it over
<code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code>.</p>

<h4>Changes to BCC to send commands to the remote BPFd</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/src/cc/libbpf.c">libbpf.c</a> is the
main C file in the BCC project that talks to the kernel for all things BPF.
This is illustrated in the diagram above. Inorder to make BCC perform BPF
operations on the remote machine instead of the local machine, parts of BCC
that make calls to the local <code>libbpf.c</code> are now instead channeled to the remote
BPFd on the target. BPFd on the target then perform the commands on behalf of
BCC running locally, by calling into its copy of <code>libbpf.c</code>.</p>

<p>One of the tricky parts to making this work is, not only calls to <code>libbpf.c</code>
but certain other paths need to be channeled to the remote machine. For example, to
attach to a tracepoint, BCC needs a list of all available tracepoints on the
system. This list has to be obtained on the remote system, not the local one and is
the exact reason why there exists the <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/blob/master/src/bpfd.c#L421">GET_TRACE_EVENTS</a>
command in BPFd.</p>

<h4>Making the kernel build for correct target processor architecture</h4>

<p>When BCC compiles the C program encapsulated in a BCC tool into eBPF
instructions, it assumes that the eBPF program will run on the same processor
architecture that BCC is running on. This is incorrect especially when building
the eBPF program for a different target.</p>

<p>Some time ago, before I started this project, I <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9961801/">changed
this</a> when building the in-kernel
eBPF samples (which are simple standalone samples and unrelated to BCC). Now, I have had to <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bcc/commit/2a2f9d41c336d8aa058338ae536bd93d31dbb1ef">make a similar
change</a>
to BCC so that it compiles the C program correctly for the target architecture.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Try it out for yourself! Follow the <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/blob/master/INSTALL.md#diy">Detailed</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/blob/master/INSTALL.md">Simple</a> instructions. Also, apply this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joelagnel/bpfd/master/patches/kernel/0001-bpf-stackmap-Implement-bpf_get_next_key.patch">kernel
patch</a>
to make it faster to run tools like offcputime. I am submitting this patch to LKML as we speak.</p>

<h3>BPF Demos: examples of BCC tools running on Android</h3>

<h4>Running filetop</h4>

<p><code>filetop</code> is a BCC tool which shows you all read/write I/O operations with a similar experience to the <code>top</code> tool.
It refreshes every few seconds, giving you a live view of these operations.
Goto your bcc directory and set the environment variables needed. For Android running on Hikey960, I run:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>joel@ubuntu:~/bcc# source arm64-adb.rc</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>which basically sets the following environment variables:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>  export ARCH=arm64
</span><span class='line'>  export BCC_KERNEL_SOURCE=/home/joel/sdb/hikey-kernel/
</span><span class='line'>  export BCC_REMOTE=adb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You could also use the convenient bcc-set script provided in BPFd sources to set these environment variables for you.
Check <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a> file in BPFd sources for more information.</p>

<p>Next I start <code>filetop</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>joel@ubuntu:~/bcc# ./tools/filetop.py 5</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This tells the tool to monitor file I/O every 5 seconds.</p>

<p>While <code>filetop</code> is running, I start the stock email app in Android and the output looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Notice the Email.apk being read by Android to load the email application, and then various other reads happening related
to the email app. Finally, WifiService continously reads iface_state_fmt to get network statistics for Android
accounting.</p>

<h4>Running biosnoop</h4>

<p>Biosnoop is another great tool shows you block level I/O operations (bio) happening on the system along with the latency
and size of the operation. Following is a sample output of running <code>tools/biosnoop.py</code> while doing random things in the
Android system.</p>

<h3>Open issues as of this writing</h3>

<p>While most issues have been fixed, a few remain. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/bpfd/issues">issue
tracker</a> and contribute patches or help by testing.</p>

<h3>Other usecases for BPFd</h3>

<p>While the main usecase at the moment is easier use of BCC tools on cross-development models, another potential usecase
that&rsquo;s gaining interest is easy loading of a BPF program. The BPFd code can be stored on disk in base64 format and sent
to bpfd using something as simple as:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>joel@ubuntu:~/bpfprogs# cat my_bpf_prog.base64 | bpfd</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the Android kernel team, we are also expermenting for certain usecases that need eBPF, with loading a program with a
forked BPFd instance, creating maps, and then pinning them for use at a later time once BPFd exits and then kill the
BPFd fork since its done. Creating a separate process (fork/exec of BPFd) and having it load the eBPF program for you
has the distinct advantage that the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/samples/bpf/bpf_load.c#L546">runtime-fixing up map file
descriptors</a> isn&rsquo;t needed in the loaded eBPF machine
instructions. In other words, the eBPF program&rsquo;s instructions can be pre-determined and statically loaded. The reason
for this convience is BPFd starts with the same number of file descriptors each time before the first map is created.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Building code for instrumentation on a different machine than the one actually
running the debugging code is beneficial and BPFd makes this possible.
Alternately, one could also write tracing code in their own kernel module on a
development machine, copy it over to a remote target, and do similar
tracing/debugging.  However, this is quite unsafe since kernel modules can
crash the kernel. On the other hand, eBPF programs are verified before they&rsquo;re
run and are guaranteed to be safe when loaded into the kernel, unlike kernel
modules.  Furthermore, the BCC project offers great support for parsing the
output of maps, processing them and presenting results all using the friendly
Python programming language. BCC tools are quite promising and could be the
future for easier and safer deep tracing endeavours. BPFd can hopefully make it
even more easier to run these tools for folks such as Embedded system and Android
developers who typically compile their kernels on their local machine and run
them on a non-local target machine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Non-maskable interrupts (NMI) is a really useful feature for debugging, that hardware can provide. Unfortunately ARM doesn&rsquo;t provide an out-of-the-box NMI interrupt mechanism. This post shows a flamegraph issue due to missing NMI support, and the upstream work being done to simulate NMI in ARMv8.</p>

<p>Some great Linux kernel features that rely on NMI to work properly are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Backtrace from all CPUs: A number of places in the kernel rely on dumping the stacks of all CPUs at the time of a failure to determine what was going on. Some of them are <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/hung_task.c">Hung Task detection</a>, <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/lockup-watchdogs.txt">Hard/soft lockup detector</a> and spinlock debugging code.</p></li>
<li><p>Perf profiling and flamegraphs: To be able to profile code that runs in interrupt handlers, or in sections of code that disable interrupts, Perf relies on NMI support in the architecture. <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpuflamegraphs.html">flamegraphs</a> are a great visual representation of perf profile output. Below is a flamegraph I generated from perf profile output, that shows just what happens on an architecture like ARMv8 with missing NMI support. Perf is using maskable-interrupts on this platform for profiling:</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/nmi/flamegraph.png"></p>

<p>As you can see in the area of the flamegraph where the arrow is pointed, a large amount of time is spent in <code>_raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore</code>. It can baffle anyone looking at this data for the first time, and make them think that most of the time is spent in the unlock function. What&rsquo;s actually happenning is because perf is using a maskable interrupt in ARMv8 to do its profiling, any section of code that disables interrupts will not be see in the flamegraph (not be profiled). In other words perf is unable to peek into sections of code where interrupts are disabled. As a result, when interrupts are reenabled during the <code>_raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore</code>, the perf interrupt routine then kicks in and records the large number of samples that elapsed in the interrupt-disable section but falsely accounts it to the _raw_spin_unlock_restore function during which the perf interrupt got a chance to run. Hence the flamegraph anomaly. It is indeed quite sad that ARM still doesn&rsquo;t have a true NMI which perf would love to make use of.</p>

<p>BUT! <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/19/583">Daniel Thompson</a> has been hard at work trying to simulate Non-maskable interrupts on ARMv8. The idea is <a href="/misc/arm-irq-priortization-white-paper.pdf">based on using interrupt priorities</a> and is the subject of the rest of this post.</p>

<h2>NMI Simulation using priorities</h2>

<p>To simulate an NMI, Daniel creates 2 groups of interrupts in his patchset. One group is for all &lsquo;normal&rsquo; interrupts, and the other for non-maskable interrupts (NMI). Non-maskable interrupts are assigned a higher priority than the normal interrupt group. Inorder to &lsquo;mask&rsquo; interrupts in this approach, Daniel replaces the regular interrupt masking scheme in the kernel which happens at the CPU-core level, with setting of the interrupt controller&rsquo;s PMR (priority mask register). When the PMR is set to a certain value, only interrupts which have a higher priority than what&rsquo;s in the PMR will be signaled to a CPU core, all other interrupts will be silenced (masked). By using this technique, it is possible to mask normal interrupts while keeping the NMI unmasked all the time.</p>

<p>Just how does he do this? So, a small primer on interrupts in the ARM world.
ARM uses the GIC <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0176c/ar01s03s01.html">Generic interrupt controller</a> to prioritize and route interrupts to CPU cores. GIC interrupt priorties go from 0 to 255. 0 being highest and 255 being the lowest. By default, the kernel <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/irqchip/arm-gic.h?v=4.8#L57">assigns priority 0xa0 (192)</a> to all interrupts. He changes this default priority from 0xa0 to 0xc0 (you&rsquo;ll see why).
He then defines what values of PMR would be consider as &ldquo;unmasked&rdquo; vs &ldquo;masked&rdquo;. Masked is 0xb0 and unmasked is 0xf0. This results in the following priorities (greater numbers are lower priority).</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>0xf0 (240 decimal)  (11110000 binary) - Interrupts Unmasked (enabled)
</span><span class='line'>0xc0 (192 decimal)  (11000000 binary) - Normal interrupt priority
</span><span class='line'>0xb0 (176 decimal)  (10110000 binary) - Interrupts masked   (disabled)
</span><span class='line'>0x80 (128 decimal)  (10000000 binary) - Non-maskable interrupts</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this new scheme, when interrupts are to be masked (disabled), the PMR is set to 0xf0 and when they are unmasked (enabled), the PMR is set to 0xb0. As you can see, setting the PMR to 0xb0 indeed masks normal interrupts, because 0xb0(PMR) &lt; 0xc0(Normal), however non-maskable interrupts still stay unmasked as 0x80(NMI) &lt; 0xb0(PMR). Also notice that inorder to mask/unmask interrupts, all that needs to be done is flip bit 7 in the PMR (0xb0 &ndash;> 0xf0). Daniel largely uses Bit 7 as the mask bit in the patchset.</p>

<h2>Quirk 1: Saving of the PMR context during traps</h2>

<p>Its suggested in the patchset that during traps, the priority value set in the PMR needs to be saved because it may change during traps. To facilitate this, Daniel found a dummy bit in the PSTATE register (PSR). During any exception, Bit 7 of of the PMR is saved into a PSR bit (he calls it the G bit) and restores it on return from the exception. Look at the changes to <code>kernel_entry</code> macro in the set for this code.</p>

<h2>Quirk 2: Ack of masked interrupts</h2>

<p>Note that interrupts are masked before the GIC interrupt controller code can even identify the source of the interrupt. When the GIC code eventually runs, it is tasked with identifying the interrupt source. It does so by reading the <code>IAR</code> register. This read also has the affecting of &ldquo;Acking&rdquo; the interrupt &ndash; in other words, telling the GIC that the kernel has acknowledged the interrupt request for that particular source. Daniel points out that, because the new scheme uses PMR for interrupt masking, its no longer possible to ACK interrupts without first unmasking them (by resetting the PMR) so he temporarily resets PMR, does the <code>IAR</code> read, and restores it. Look for the code in <code>gic_read_iar_common</code> in his patchset to handle this case.</p>

<h2>Open questions I have</h2>

<ul>
<li>Where in the patchset does Daniel mask NMIs once an NMI is in progress, or is this even needed?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Future work</h2>

<p>Daniel has tested his patchset only on the foundation model yet, but it appears that the patch series with modifications should work on the newer Qualcomm chipsets that have the necessary GIC (Generic interrupt controller) access from the core to mess with IRQ priorities. Also, currently Daniel has only implemented CPU backtrace, more work needs to be done for perf support which I&rsquo;ll look into if I can get backtraces working properly on real silicon first.</p>
