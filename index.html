  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ftrace events are a mechanism that allows different pieces of code in the kernel to &lsquo;broadcast&rsquo; events of interest. Such as a scheduler context-switch <code>sched_switch</code> for example. In the scheduler core&rsquo;s <code>__schedule</code> function, you&rsquo;ll see something like: <code>trace_sched_switch(preempt, prev, next);</code>
This immediately results in a write to a per-cpu ring buffer storing info about what the previous task was, what the next one is, and whether the switch is happening as a result of kernel preemption (versus happening for other reasons such as a task waiting for I/O completion).</p>

<p>Under the hood, these ftrace events are actually implemented using tracepoints. The terms events are tracepoints appear to be used interchangeably, but it appears one could use a trace point if desired without having to do anything with ftrace. Events on the other hand use ftrace.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss a bit about how a tracepoint works. Tracepoints are hooks that are inserted into points of code of interest and call a certain function of your choice (also known as a function probe). Inorder for the tracepoint to do anything, you have to register a function using <code>tracepoint_probe_register</code>. Multiple functions can be registered in a single hook. Once your tracepoint is hit, all functions registered to the tracepoint are executed. Also note that if no function is registered to the tracepoint, then the tracepoint is essentially a NOP with zero-overhead. Actually that&rsquo;s a lie, there is a branch (and some space) overhead only although negligible.</p>

<p>Here is the heart of the code that executes when a tracepoint is hit:</p>

<p>The <code>static_key_false</code> in the above code will evaluate to false if there&rsquo;s no probe registered to the tracepoint.</p>

<p>Digging further, <code>__DO_TRACE</code> does the following in <code>include/linux/tracepoint.h</code></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot going on there, but main part is the loop that goes through all function pointers (probes) that were registered to the tracepoint and calls them one after the other.</p>

<p>Now, here&rsquo;s some secrets. Since all ftrace events are tracepoints under the hood, you can piggy back onto interesting events in your kernel with your own probes. This allows you to write interesting tracers. Infact this is precisely how blktrace works, and also is how SystemTap hooks into ftrace events.
<a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/joel-snips/blob/master/k-patches/cpuhists.diff">Checkout a module I wrote</a> that hooks onto <code>sched_switch</code> to build some histograms. The code there is still buggy but if you mess with it and improve it please share your work.</p>

<p>Now that we know a good amount about tracepoints, ftrace events are easy.</p>

<p>An ftrace event being based on tracepoints, makes full use of it but it has to do more. Ofcourse, it has to write events out to the ring buffer.
When you enable an ftrace event using debug-fs, at that instant the ftrace events framework registers an &ldquo;event probe&rdquo; function at the tracepoint that represents the event. How? Using <code>tracepoint_probe_register</code> just as we discussed.</p>

<p>The code for this is in the file <code>kernel/trace/trace_events.c</code> in function <code>trace_event_reg</code>.</p>

<p>The probe function <code>call-&gt;class-&gt;probe</code> for trace events is defined in the file <code>include/trace/trace_events.h</code> and does the job of writing to the ring buffer. In a nutshell, the code gets a handle into the ring buffer, does assignment of the values to the entry structure and writes it out. There is some magic going on here to accomodate arbitrary number of arguments but I am yet to figure that out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><code>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</code> is one of the many &ldquo;thread information flags&rdquo; stored along side every task in the Linux Kernel. One of the flags which is vital to the working of preemption is <code>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</code>. Inorder to explain why its important and how it works, I will go over 2 cases where <code>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</code> is used.</p>

<h2>Preemption</h2>

<p>Preemption is the process of forceably grabbing CPU from a user or kernel context and giving it to someone else (user or kernel). It is the means for timesharing a CPU between competing tasks (I will use task as terminology for process).
In Linux, the way it works is a timer interrupt (called the tick) interrupts the task that is running and makes a decision about whether a task or a kernel code path (executing on behalf of a task like in a syscall) is to be preempted. This decision is based on whether the task has been running long-enough and something higher priority woke up and needs CPU now, or is ready to run.</p>

<p>These things happen in <code>scheduler_tick()</code>, the exact path is <em>TIMER HARDWARE INTERRUPT</em> &ndash;> <code>scheduler_tick</code> &ndash;> <code>task_tick_fair</code> &ndash;> <code>entity_tick</code> &ndash;> <code>check_preempt_tick</code>.
<code>entity_tick()</code> updates various run time statistics of the task, and <code>check_preempt_tick()</code> is where TIF_NEED_RESCHED is set.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a small bit of code in <code>check_preempt_tick</code></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>        if (delta_exec &gt; ideal_runtime) {
</span><span class='line'>                resched_curr(rq_of(cfs_rq));
</span><span class='line'>                /*

</span><span class='line'>                 */
</span><span class='line'>                clear_buddies(cfs_rq, curr);
</span><span class='line'>                return;
</span><span class='line'>        }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here you see a decision is made that the process ran long enough based on its runtime and if so call <code>resched_curr</code>. Turns out <code>resched_curr</code> sets the <code>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</code> for the current task! This informs whoever looks at the flag, that this process should be scheduled out soon.</p>

<p>Even though this flag is set at this point, the task is not going to be preempted yet. This is because preemption happens at specific points such as exit of interrupts. If the flag is set because the timer interrupt (scheduler decided) decided that something of higher priority needs CPU now and sets <code>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</code>, then at the exit of the timer interrupt (interrupt exit path), <code>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</code> is checked, and because it is set &ndash; <code>schedule()</code> is called causing context switch to happen to another process of higher priority, instead of just returning to the existing process that the timer interrupted normally would.
Lets examine where this happens.</p>

<p>For return from interrupt to user-mode:</p>

<p>If the tick interrupt happened user-mode code was running, then in somewhere in the interrupt exit path for x86, this call chain calls schedule <code>ret_from_intr</code> &ndash;> <code>reint_user</code> &ndash;> <code>prepare_exit_to_usermode</code>. Here the need_reched flag is checked, and if true <code>schedule()</code> is called.</p>

<p>For return from interrupt to kernel mode, things are a bit different (skip this para if you think it&rsquo;ll confuse you).</p>

<p>This feature requires kernel preemption to be enabled. The call chain doing the preemption is: <code>ret_from_intr</code> &ndash;> <code>reint_kernel</code> &ndash;> <code>preempt_schedule_irq</code> (see <code>arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S</code>) which calls <code>schedule</code>.
Note that, for return to kernel mode, I see that <code>preempt_schedule_irq</code> calls <code>schedule</code> anyway whether need_resched flag is set or not, this is probably Ok but I am wondering if need_resched should be checked here before <code>schedule</code> is called. Perhaps it would be an optimiziation to avoid unecessarily calling <code>schedule</code>. One reason for not doing so would be, say any other interrupt other than timer tick is returning to the interrupted kernel space, then in these cases for example &ndash; if the timer tick didn&rsquo;t get a chance to run (because all other local interrupts are disabled in Linux until an interrupt finishes, in this case our non-timer interrupt), then we&rsquo;d want the exit path of the non-timer interrupt to behave just like the exit path of the timer tick interrupt would behave, whether need_resched is set or not.</p>

<h2>Critical sections in kernel code where preemption is off</h2>

<p>One nice example of a code path where preemption is off is the <code>mutex_lock</code> path in the kernel. In the kernel, there is an optimization where if a mutex is already locked and not available, but if the lock owner (the task currently holding the lock) is running on another CPU, then the mutex temporarily becomes a spinlock (which means it will spin until it can get the lock) instead of behaving like a mutex (which sleeps until the lock is available). The pseudo code looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mutex_lock() {
</span><span class='line'>  disable_preempt();
</span><span class='line'>  if (lock can't be acquired and the lock holding task is currently running) {
</span><span class='line'>  while (lock_owner_running && !need_resched()) {
</span><span class='line'>      cpu_relax();
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>  enable_preempt();
</span><span class='line'>  acquire_lock_or_sleep();
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The lock path does exactly what I described. <code>cpu_relax()</code> is arch specific which is called when the CPU has to do nothing but wait. It gives hints to the CPU that it can put itself into an idle state or use its resources for someone else. For x86, it involves calling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLT">halt instruction</a>.</p>

<p>What I noticed is the Ftrace latency tracer complained about a long delay in the preempt disabled path of mutex_lock for one of my tests, and I made some <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-rt-users/msg15022.html">noise</a> about it on the mailing list. Disabling preemption for long periods is generally a bad thing to do because during this duration, no other task can be scheduled on the CPU. However, Steven <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-rt-users/msg15025.html">pointed out that</a> for this particular case, since we&rsquo;re checking for need_resched() and breaking out of the loop, we should be Ok. What would happen is, the scheduling timer interrupt (which calls <code>scheduler_tick()</code> I mentioned earlier) comes in and checks if higher priority tasks need CPU, and if they do, it sets <code>TIF_NEED_RESCHED</code>. Once the timer interrupt returns to our tightly spinning loop in mutex_lock, we would break out of the loop having noticed <code>need_resched()</code> and, re-enable preemption as shown in the code above. Thus the long duration of preemption doesn&rsquo;t turn out to be a problem as long tasks that need CPU are prioritized correctly. <code>need_resched()</code> achieved this fairness.</p>

<p>Next time you see <code>if (need_resched())</code> in kernel code, you&rsquo;ll have a better idea why its there :). Let me know your comments if any.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The ftrace irqsoff, preempt and preemptirqsoff tracers are amazing tools identify paths in Linux kernel code that block tasks from getting CPU-time. Essentially during these paths, the scheduler has its hands tied behind its back. There are mainly 2 cases where this can happen.</p>

<p>Local Interrupts disabled (masked):
All CPU cores have a bit in a &lsquo;flags&rsquo; or status register, that is used to mask interrupts on that particular CPU. For x86 architectures, its in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register">FLAGS register</a> called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_flag">IF bit</a>. With this bit set, timer interrupts wont be received without which the scheduler wont get a chance to run and schedule something else.</p>

<p>Preemption disabled:
Preemption is often disabled in the kernel when acquiring spinlocks. We went over the mechanics of spinlocks <a href="http://www.linuxinternals.org/blog/2014/05/07/spinlock-implementation-in-linux-kernel/">previously</a>. There are other cases where preepmtion may be disabled as well. With preemption turned off, the scheduler will not preempt an existing task and prevent giving some other task a chance to run.</p>

<p>Both these cases introduce latency to runnable tasks and so they are bad for predictablity and real-timeness. Disabling interrupts is worse than turning off preemption because this also has the added effect of introducing latency to other interrupts.</p>

<p>The tracers I just mentioned are called latency tracers and they trace the total latency and optionally the functions that are executed between when irqs are turned off and on, or when preempt is turned off and on. They are <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt">documented well</a> so I wont go over them here.</p>

<p>One thing I want to mention is about the preemptirqsoff tracer, it starts when when <em>either</em> preempt <em>or</em> irqs are turned off, and stops tracing only when <em>both</em> preemption and irqs are turned back on.
This makes the preemptirqsoff tracer excellent in tracing kernel code paths that are blocking a task because regardless of whether preemption or irqs causing the latency, it treats both these cases identical or interchangeable. Borrowing from the amazing documentation, the following example illustrates this:</p>

<p>It appears though that function tracing in preempt tracers is a bit broken and I <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/3/12/24">posted a fix</a> for a bug which prevent tracing functions which were called while interrupts were enabled and preemption is disabled. So in the above example, call_function_with_preemption_off wouldn&rsquo;t be traced. It still tracks the max latency and reports it, but it would omit the tracing of this function.</p>

<p>Coming back to the original topic of understanding critical section kernel behavior, the beautiful ftrace output for latency tracers show you a set of flags on the left beside every function traced which illustrates what is going on with preemption and interrupts in the traced function. Here I will go over a set of trace outputs and show you some interesting things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/207492/how-are-conflicts-between-voltage-sources-or-signals-resolved/207496">asked</a> a question on StackExchange about what happens when 2 voltage signals are tied together. What&rsquo;s the resultant voltage and what decides this voltage? The whole train of thought started when I was trying to contemplate what happens when you use pull-ups on signals that are not Open Drain.</p>

<p>I create and simulated a Circuit with the same scenario in LTSpice. &ldquo;V&rdquo; is the voltage between the &ldquo;+&rdquo; terminals of V1 and V2 and its shown on the right of the simulation. We will confirm the simulation result by doing some math later.<img src="/images/voltage-conflict/voltage-conflict-1.png"></p>

<p>The question is what is the voltage across the load after hooking them up together. And what do the currents look like? Is there a current flowing between the 2 sources as well (apart from the current flowing to the load) because 5v > 1.8v?
The simulator refuses to do a simulation without your author adding an internal resistance to the voltage sources first. All voltages sources have certain internal resistances, so that&rsquo;s fair. This can be considered analogous to having a voltage signal with a certain resistance along its path which limits its current sourcing (or sinking) capabilities.</p>

<p>So I added 1k resistances internally, normally the resistance of a voltage source is far less than this. AA batteries have just 0.1-0.2ohms.
Now the circuit looks something like this: <img src="/images/voltage-conflict/voltage-conflict-2.png"></p>

<p>One can simply apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_current_law_.28KCL.29">Kirchoff&rsquo;s current law</a> to the above circuit, the direction of currents would be as in the circuit. I1 and I2 are the currents flowing through R2 and R1 respectively.</p>

<p>By Kirchoff&rsquo;s law, All the current entering the node labeled V will be equal to the current exiting it even if the currents are not in the actual direction shown above. From this we see:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>I1 = (1.8 - V) / 1k
</span><span class='line'>I2 = (5 - V)   / 1k
</span><span class='line'>I3 = (V - 0)   / 10k
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>I3 = I2 + I1
</span><span class='line'>V / 10k  = ((1.8 - V) / 1k) + ((5 - V) / 1k)
</span><span class='line'>V = 3.2381v</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Fom this we see the voltage at V is somewhere between 5 and 1.8v. Infact, where it is between 5 and 1.8 depends on how strong or weak the resistances associated with the sources are. If the resistances are lower, then the sources have more of an influence and vice versa. An interesting observation is I1 is negative if you plug V=3.2v in the above equation. This means the current for voltage source V2 (the 1.8v voltage source) is actually flowing into it rather than out of it (its being sinked) and so I1 is actually opposite in direction to the picture shown above.</p>

<p>A simpler case is having 2 voltage sources of the exact same voltage values, in this case the circuit would look like:<img src="/images/voltage-conflict/voltage-conflict-3.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9venin%27s_theorem">Thevenin&rsquo;s theorem</a>  provides an easy simplication into the following, where the equivalent voltage source value is the same but the series resistance is now halved. This results in the following circuit:
<img src="/images/voltage-conflict/voltage-conflict-4.png"></p>

<p>Now you can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider">Voltage divider</a> concept and easily solve this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>V = V2 * (R2 / (R1 + R2) )
</span><span class='line'>  = 1.8v * ( 10k / (10k + 0.5k) )
</span><span class='line'>  = 1.7142v</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you would notice, the 1k resistance dropped around 0.085v of voltage before getting to the 10k load.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been wanting to remotely be able to program a MicroSD card with a new bootloader or filesystem <em>without</em> removing the card from its embedded target board (such as a Beaglebone or Pandaboard). Due to the lack of any such existing tools, I decided to design my own board. Finally have got it working, below are some pictures and a screencast demo video of the switcher in action! I sprinkled some power and status LED to show the user what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>The base board requires two <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9419">SparkFun MicroSD sniffers</a>. The card cage on the sniffer is unused for my purposes. The switcher is controlled through an <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9717">FTDI cable</a>.
I also <a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/microsd-switch/blob/master/sw/switch.c">wrote up</a> a <code>switch</code> program to control the switcher with libftdi. You just have to pass to it the FTDI&rsquo;s serial number and whether you want to switch to host-mode (for programming the card) or target-mode (for booting the programmed card).

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This article tries to clarify how spinlocks are implemented in the Linux kernel and how they should be used correctly in the face of preemption and interrupts. The focus of this article will be more on basic concepts than details, as details tend to be forgotten more easily and shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to look up although attention is paid to it to the extent that it helps understanding.</p>

<p>Fundamentally somewhere in <code>include/linux/spinlock.h</code>, a decision is made on which spinlock header to pull based on whether SMP is enabled or not:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'># include &lt;linux/spinlock_api_up.h&gt;
</span><span class='line'>#endif</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We&rsquo;ll go over how things are implemented in both the SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processor) and UP (Uni-Processor) cases.</p>

<p>For the SMP case, <code>__raw_spin_lock*</code> functions in <code>kernel/locking/spinlock.c</code> are called when one calls some version of a <code>spin_lock</code>.</p>

<p>Following is the definition of the most basic version defined with a macro:</p>

<p>The function has several imporant bits. First it disables preemption on line 5, then tries to <em>atomically</em> acquire the spinlock on line 6. If it succeeds it breaks from the <code>for</code> loop on line 7, leaving preemption disabled for the duration of crticial section being protected by the lock. If it didn&rsquo;t succeed in acquiring the lock (maybe some other CPU grabbed the lock already), it enables preemption back and spins till it can acquire the lock keeping <em>preemption enabled during this period</em>. Each time it detects that the lock can&rsquo;t be acquired in the <code>while</code> loop, it calls an architecture specific relax function which has the effect executing some variant of a <code>no-operation</code> instruction that causes the CPU to execute such an instruction efficiently in a lower power state. We&rsquo;ll talk about the <code>break_lock</code> usage in a bit. Soon as it knows the lock is free, say the <code>raw_spin_can_lock(lock)</code> function returned 1, it goes back to the beginning of the <code>for</code> loop and tries to acquire the lock again.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s important to note here is the reason for keeping preemption enabled (we&rsquo;ll see in a bit that for UP configurations, this is not done). While the kernel is spinning on a lock, other processes shouldn&rsquo;t be kept from preempting the spinning thread. The lock in these cases have been acquired on a <em>different CPU</em> because (assuming bug free code) it&rsquo;s impossible the current CPU which is trying to grab the lock has already acquired it, because preemption is disabled on acquiral. So it makes sense for the spinning kernel thread to be preempted giving others CPU time.
It is also possible that more than one process on the current CPU is trying to acquire the same lock and spinning on it, in this case the kernel gets continuously preempted between the 2 threads fighting for the lock, while some other CPU in the cluster happily holds the lock, hopefully for not too long.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the <code>break_lock</code> element in the lock structure comes in. Its used to signal to the lock-holding processor in the cluster that there is someone else trying to acquire the lock. This can cause the lock to released early by the holder if required.</p>

<p>Now lets see what happens in the UP (Uni-Processor) case.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, it&rsquo;s really this simple:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>// ....skipped some lines.....

<p>All that needs to be done is to disable preemption and acquire the lock. The code really doesn&rsquo;t do anything other than disable preemption. The references to the <code>lock</code> variable are just to suppress compiler warnings as mentioned in comments in the source file.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no spinning at all here like the UP case and the reason is simple: in the SMP case, remember we had agreed that while a lock is <em>acquired</em> by a particular CPU (in this case just the 1 CPU), no other process on that CPU should have acquired the lock. How could it have gotten a chance to do so with preemption disabled on that CPU to begin with?</p>

<p>Even if the code is buggy, (say the same process tries to acquires the lock twice), it&rsquo;s still impossible that 2 <em>different processes</em> try to acquire the same lock on a Uni-Processor system considering preemption is disabled on lock acquiral. Following that idea, in the Uni-processor case, since we are running on only 1 CPU, all that needs to be done is to disable preemption, since the fact that we are being allowed to disable preemption to begin with, means that no one else has acquired the lock. Works really well!</p>

<h2>Sharing spinlocks between interrupt and process-context</h2>

<p>It is possible that a critical section needs to be protected by the same lock in both an interrupt and in non-interrupt (process) execution context in the kernel. In this case <code>spin_lock_irqsave</code> and the <code>spin_unlock_irqrestore</code> variants have to be used to protect the critical section. This has the effect of disabling interrupts on the  executing CPU. Imagine what would happen if you just used <code>spin_lock</code> in the process context?</p>

<p>Picture the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Process context kernel code acquires <em>lock A</em> using <code>spin_lock</code>.</li>
<li>While the lock is held, an interrupt comes in on the same CPU and executes.</li>
<li>Interrupt Service Routing (ISR) tries to acquire <em>lock A</em>, and spins continuously waiting for it.</li>
<li>For the duration of the ISR, the Process context is blocked and never gets a chance to run and free the lock.</li>
<li>Hard lock up condition on the CPU!</li>
</ol>


<p>To prevent this, the process context code needs call <code>spin_lock_irqsave</code> which has the effect of disabling interrupts on that particular CPU along with the regular disabling of preemption we saw earlier <em>before</em> trying to grab the lock.</p>

<p>Note that the ISR can still just call <code>spin_lock</code> instead of <code>spin_lock_irqsave</code> because interrupts are disabled anyway during ISR execution. Often times people use <code>spin_lock_irqsave</code> in an ISR, that&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>

<p>Also note that during the executing of the critical section protected by <code>spin_lock_irqsave</code>, the interrupts are only disabled on the executing CPU. The same interrupt can come in on a different CPU and the ISR will be executed there, but that will not trigger the hard lock condition I talked about, because the process-context code is not blocked and can finish executing the locked critical section and release the lock while the ISR spins on the lock on a different CPU waiting for it. The process context does get a chance to finish and free the lock causing no hard lock up.</p>

<p>Following is what the <code>spin_lock_irqsave</code> code looks like for the SMP case, UP case is similar, look it up. BTW, the only difference here compared to the regular <code>spin_lock</code> I described in the beginning are the <code>local_irq_save</code> and <code>local_irq_restore</code> that accompany the <code>preempt_disable</code> and <code>preempt_enable</code> in the lock code:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having read the chapter on counting and per-CPU counters in <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/paul-e-mckenney/is-parallel-programming-hard-and-if-so-what-can-you-do-about-it-first-bw-print-edition/paperback/product-21562459.html">Paul Mckenney&rsquo;s recent book</a>, I thought I would do a small experiment to check how good or bad it would be if those per-CPU counters were close to each other in memory.</p>

<p>Paul talks about using one global shared counter for N threads on N CPUs, and the effects it can have on the cache. Each CPU core&rsquo;s cache in an SMP system will need exclusive rights on a specific cache line of memory, before it can do the write. This means that, at any given time <em>only one</em> CPU can and should do a write to that part of memory.</p>

<p>This is accomplished typically by an invalidate protocol, where each CPU needs to do some inter-processor communication before it can assume it has exclusive access to that cache line, and also read any copies that may still be in some other core&rsquo;s cache and not in main memory. This is an expensive operation that is to be avoided at all costs!</p>

<p>Then Paul goes about saying, OK- let&rsquo;s have a per-thread counter, and have each core increment it independently, and when we need a read out, we would grab a lock and add all of the individual counters together. This works great, assuming each per-thread counter is separated by atleast a cache line. That&rsquo;s guaranteed, when one uses the <code>__thread</code> primitive nicely separating out the memory to reduce cache line sharing effects.</p>

<p>So I decided to flip this around, and have per-thread counters that were closely spaced and do some counting with them. Instead of using <code>__thread</code>, I created an array of counters, each element belonging to some thread. The counters are still separate and not shared, but they may still be in shared cache-line causing the nasty effects we talked about, which I wanted to measure.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joelagnel/smp-experiments/blob/05afb2db4fea1c6c0b4614c180186c10627a341a/cache-sharing.c">My program</a> sets up N counting threads, and assumes its running each of them on a single core on typical multicore system.  Various iterations of per-thread counting is done, with the counters separated by increasing powers of 2 each iteration. After each iteration, I stop all threads, add the per-thread counter values and report the result.</p>

<p>Below are the results of running the program on 3 different SMP systems (2 threads on 2 CPUs, sorry I don&rsquo;t have better multi-core hardware ATM):</p>

<p>Effect of running on a reference ARM dual-core Cortex-A9 system:
<img src="/images/cache-sharing/a9-counts.jpeg"></p>

<p>Notice the jump in through-put once the separation changes from 16 to 32 bytes. That gives us a good idea that the L1 cache line size on Cortex-A9 systems is 32 bytes (8 words). Something the author didn&rsquo;t know for sure in advance (I initially thought it was 64-bytes).</p>

<p>Effect of running on a reference ARM dual-core Cortex-A15 system:
<img src="/images/cache-sharing/a15-counts.jpeg"></p>

<p>L1 Cache-line size of Cortex A-15 is 64 bytes (8 words). Expected jump for a separation of 64 bytes.</p>

<p>Effect of running on a x86-64 i7-3687U dual-core CPU:
<img src="/images/cache-sharing/x86-counts.jpeg">.</p>

<p>L1 Cache-line size of this CPU is 64 bytes too (8 words). Expected jump for a separation of 64 bytes.</p>

<p>This shows your parallel programs need to take care of cache-line alignment to avoid false-sharing effects. Also, doing something like this in your program is an indirect way to find out what the cache-line size is for your CPU, or a direct way to get fired, whichever way you want to look at it. ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of folks ask <em>why do you have to do fork and then an exec, to execute a new program?</em> and <em>why can&rsquo;t it be done in one step?</em>, or <em>why does fork <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html">create a copy-on-writed address space</a>, to only have it thrown away later when you do an exec?</em>. So I decided do a small write up about this topic.</p>

<p>On a separate note, firstly it is important to remember that <code>fork</code> is not used for threading, its primary use is to create a separate process, that is a child of the parent process that called <code>fork</code>.</p>

<p>Normally one might think that doing a <code>fork</code> and separate <code>exec</code> can be combined in one step, and it probably should be. But there are applications of maintaining this separation. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1345320/applications-of-fork-system-call">post that explains</a> why you might need to do just a <code>fork</code> call. Summarizing the post, you may need to setup some initial data and &ldquo;fork&rdquo; a bunch of workers. All these works are supposed to execute in <em>their own</em> address space and share <em>only the initial data</em>. In this case, copy-on-write is extremely useful since the initial data can be shared in physical memory and forking this way would be extremely cheap. The kernel marks all these shared pages as read only, and makes writable copies of shared data when they are written to.</p>

<p>There is a small overhead if <code>fork</code> is followed immediately by an <code>exec</code> system call, since the copy-on-write shared address space is of no use and is thrown away anyway. Combining both the <code>fork</code>, <code>exec</code> in this case might might have some advantages, reducing this overhead.</p>

<h2>Linux Implementation of Copy-on-write (COW) for shared Virtual Memory Areas</h2>

<p>Some of this COW code that executes on a fork can be found in <code>mm/memory.c</code>. There is an is_cow function to detect if a virtual memory area (a region of virtual memory, see <code>/proc/self/maps</code>) is copy-on-write.</p>

<p>A VMA (Virtual Memory Area) is a contiguous segment of virtual memory belonging to a particular process. Every VMA has a bunch of VM_ flags associated with it. <code>VM_MAYWRITE</code>, relevant to the above code, is used to mark that a mapped region can be changed to writable by mprotect system call. It is possible that a memory region is initially readonly and the user wants to make it writable. <code>VM_MAYWRITE</code> gives that permission. Note that if if the kernel doesn&rsquo;t set <code>VM_MAYWRITE</code>, then the region is automatically not COW because there is no question of writing to it.</p>

<p>When a memory mapping is created via the mmap system call, and if <code>MAP_SHARED</code> is passed in flags, the <code>VM_SHARED</code> bit is set for the VMA and as a result the region is not copy-on-write (The above is_cow_mapping function returns false). By definition, shared memory regions are just that &ndash; shared. So no need copy-on-write. In other words, If the VMA is a shared mapping or is a read only mapping, then it isn&rsquo;t a COW mapping.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take the example of mapping a file using mmap,</p>

<p>By default in the kernel on VMA creation, the VMA flags is set to <code>VM_SHARED = 0</code> and <code>VM_MAYWRITE = 1</code>. Now if mmap is asked it to create a shared mapping of a file by passing it <code>MAP_SHARED</code> flag, for example, that can be shared with other processes that are being forked, then the <code>VM_SHARED</code> bit is set to 1 for that VMA. Additionally if the file is opened in read only mode, then <code>VM_MAYWRITE</code> is set to 1. This has the effect of making is_cow_mapping return false. Ofcourse, the shared mapping doesn&rsquo;t need to be a COW.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> is passed in the flags to mmap, then <code>VM_SHARED</code> bit is set to 0, and <code>VM_MAYWRITE</code> remains at 1 (regardless of whether the file is read or write opened, since writes will not be carried to the underlying file). This makes is_cow_mapping return true. Indeed, private mappings should be copy-on-write enabled.</p>

<p>You can see the code I&rsquo;m talking about <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/mmap.c#L1284">conveniently here</a>.</p>

<p>The important point here is that every mapping is either a COW mapping or not a COW mapping. During the <code>clone</code> system call which is called by <code>fork</code> library call internally, if the <code>CLONE_VM</code> flag is not passed to <code>clone</code> as is the case internally within <code>fork</code>, then all the VMA mappings of the parent process are copied to the child, including the page table entries. In this case, any writes to COW mappings should trigger a copy on write. The main thing to note is the children <em>inherit</em> the COW property of all the copied VMA mappings of its parent and don&rsquo;t need to be explictly marked as COW.</p>

<p>However, If <code>CLONE_VM</code> is passed, then the VMAs are not copied and the memory descriptor of the child and the parent process are the same, in this case the child and parent share the same address space and are thus are threads. <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/fork.c#L879">See for yourself</a>. COW or no COW doesn&rsquo;t matter here.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s a question for you, For N <code>clone</code> system calls with <code>!CLONE_VM</code> passed for spawning N threads, we can just create as many VMA copies as we want each time, the COW mappings will take care of themselves. Right? Almost! There&rsquo;s more work&hellip; the <em>physical pages</em> of both the original VMA and the copy VMA have to be marked as read-only. That&rsquo;s the only way Copy-on-write of those will be triggered by the CPU when those pages are written to. Here&rsquo;s the code in <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/memory.c#L849">copy_one_pte</a> that sets this up:</p>

<p>
There you go, now when the COW memory region is written to, a page fault happens, and the page fault handler knows that the VMA of the faulting page is a COW and that&rsquo;s what triggered the page fault. It can then create a copy of the page and restart the faulting instruction, this time removing the write protection if there aren&rsquo;t any others sharing the VMA. So in short, fork+exec can be expensive if you had done lots of <code>fork</code> calls on a process with a lot of large files. Since all this copying business is wasted on doing a subsequent <code>exec</code> system call.</p>

<p>There is one optimization however, why should you have to do this marking for pages that are not physically present in memory? Those will fault anyway. So the above code is <em>not run</em> if the page is not present, nicely done by checking for <code>!pte_present(pte)</code> to be true before the preceding code.</p>
